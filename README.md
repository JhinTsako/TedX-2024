# TedX-2024
A Unity 3D two player game made for a University event.<br>
We had 3 days to finish this and we were glad its working properly and is playable.<br>
There is no build in the repo only the project as a whole.

## Reminder
Its a 2-player game, although you can play alone its recommended to have a second player for the full experience.

## Gameplay
You are on an island in the middle of an ocean, near you there are other islands but the one you want to be is right infront of you. Alas the bridge is broken so you have to make your own way across.<br>
Luckily for you you are not alone, you have a friend and he has you!<br>
Help each other to build a path across and reach the IEK DELTA Tower and head inside(cause who wouldn't).
